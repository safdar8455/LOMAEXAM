    options: [
      "To eliminate database calculation friction and prevent any form of antiselection",
      "Because the state insurance code completely outlaws charging partial commercial premiums",

      "The requirement automatically doubles once the business reaches 1,000 employees"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Larger groups naturally display more predictable claim trends due to the law of large numbers. Therefore, insurers can safely lower the required participation percentage."

    question: "Zenith Inventions receives an experience refund on its contributory plan. The refund amount is larger than the entire portion of the premium Zenith contributed. What legal rule governs the excess refund?",
    options: [
      "The excess must be used directly for the benefit of the insured group members",
      "The excess must be returned to the insurance company's terminal reserve fund",
