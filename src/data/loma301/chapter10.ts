    question: "A Customer Service Representative (CSR) at Crest Mutual receives a call from a policyowner who simply wants to verify the due date of their next premium payment and the current face value of their whole life policy. This interaction is classified under which category of routine service requests?",
    options: [
      "Providing information",
      "Making policy changes",
      "Handling returned mail",

    question: "A client contacts Oceanic Life stating they do not fully understand what happens to their policy's base coverage if their sole named beneficiary dies before them. How should the CSR handle this query under standard service practices?",
    options: [
      "Acknowledge the customer's concern, verify their identity, and explain that base coverage continues but they need to designation a new beneficiary",
      "Inform the caller that the contract immediately terminates and the cash value is forfeited",

      "Refer the caller directly to the state insurance department to resolve coverage queries"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "According to Figure 10.1, answering questions about whether coverage ends if a beneficiary dies is a standard policy coverage inquiry. Base coverage continues, and the CSR should explain options to update the beneficiary."

    id: 3,
    lo: "principle",
    question: "An automated premium alert notification is sent to a policyowner. The policyowner contacts support asking, 'Can I change how often I pay premiums from annually to monthly?' Under standard practices, the CSR should:",
    options: [
      "Explain the available frequency options, premium billing modes, and process the change if eligible",

      "Suggest that the policyowner convert their group policy to an individual term policy instantly"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Answering questions on whether policy benefits increase with salary fluctuations is a common routine benefit inquiry. The CSR reviews the group contract provisions to explain how benefit schedules correspond to wages."

      "The insurer becomes legally responsible for paying the policyholder's property taxes if the address is lost"

    id: 10,
    lo: "principle",
    question: "When a mailed policy summary is returned to Zenith Mutual, a CSR begins the search process. If the CSR is forced to use an outside fee-charging database to find the client's current location, how are these search fees typically applied?",

    id: 11,
    lo: "principle",
    question: "When processing policy changes, the underwriter's primary underwriting concerns are whether the proposed change increases the insurer's risk, whether the insured's original insurability status has changed, or both. Which change usually does NOT require additional underwriting?",
    options: [
      "Decreasing the face amount of an existing policy",
      "Adding a supplemental disability waiver benefit rider",

      "Converting a policy shortly after issue while acquisition costs are high"

    id: 12,
    lo: "principle",
    question: "If a group policyholder wants to decrease coverage for group insureds or remove one or more benefits from their group insurance plan, how does this modification affect the participation rate?",

      "It doesn't require additional underwriting unless the participation rate falls below the required minimum for the plan",
      "It automatically triggers a mandatory medical underwriting exam for all remaining participants",
      "It requires the insurer to immediately convert the group plan to absolute reinsurance",
      "It releases the employer from any legal obligation to pay group premium taxes"

    answer: 0,
    explanation: "A reduction in group coverage decreases the insurer's risk and doesn't require extra underwriting, unless employee drops cause the participation rate to fall below the mandatory group plan minimum."

    question: "A policyowner with a whole life contract moves from Florida to Texas and requests an address change. Why must the CSR update all records relating to this specific customer simultaneously?",
    options: [
      "To ensure that premium notices, dividend payments, and policy updates reach the correct location without delays",
      "To comply with federal rules that tie cash value interest rates to the billing ZIP code",
      "To trigger a mandatory change of the servicing sales intermediary based on geographic borders",
      "To force the redistribution of the policy's reserves into the Texas Guaranty Association"
