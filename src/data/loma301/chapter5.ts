  {
    id: 3,
    lo: "principle",
    question: "A high policy lapse rate can negatively affect an insurer's profitability. How does financial underwriting help maintain an excellent persistency rate?",
    options: [
      "By confirming that the proposed insured can afford the premium payments necessary to keep the policy in force",
      "By automatically converting permanent cash value policies into term life policies",
      "By adding high flat extra premiums to all policies within standard risk classes",
      "By shifting the legal responsibility of premium payments to regional reinsurance companies"

    question: "A factor table represents income replacement needs. Why is unearned or passive income excluded from factor table calculations?",
    options: [
      "Because unearned income continues to be received by surviving family members after the insured's death and does not represent a loss",
      "Because unearned income is illegal under federal anti-money laundering guidelines",

      "Because unearned income cannot be verified using tax documentation or W-2 transcripts"
