    question: "In data analysis, how is a fact distinguished from an inference?",
    options: [
      "A fact is a piece of objective information that can be proven true, whereas an inference is a conclusion drawn from facts and other data that may or may not be correct",
      "A fact is a subjective actuarial guess, whereas an inference is an unchangeable law of physics",
      "A fact applies only to sample data, whereas an inference applies exclusively to populations",
      "A fact is always expressed as a percentage, whereas an inference is always a whole integer"

    lo: "Princple",
    question: "Why does basing strategic corporate decisions on sample data introduce risk for an insurance company?",
    options: [
      "Because sample conclusions are statistical inferences that can be affected by random sampling error or bias rather than proven population facts",
      "Because sample data always requires manual hand calculations on paper spreadsheets",
      "Because state insurance regulators prohibit the use of sample surveys for any purpose",
      "Because sample data can never be entered into modern computer software"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Sample findings are inferences subject to chance variations, sampling error, and potential biases, meaning they may not perfectly reflect the true population."

    options: [
      "Considers and incorporates every single value in the population into its calculation",
      "Is completely unaffected by extreme outliers in the dataset",
      "Can only be calculated if the population has an odd number of observations",
      "Always equals the exact middle number in an ordered sequence"

    id: 14,
    lo: "Princple",
    question: "In statistical analysis, an outlier is defined as:",
    options: [

      "It cannot be calculated on numerical transaction data",
      "It ignores all values other than the highest and lowest numbers",
      "It requires dividing the sum by the square root of the variance"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Because the mean incorporates every value, a single extreme outlier can pull the mean significantly away from the true center of typical observations."

    id: 18,
    lo: "Princple",
    question: "When a dataset contains an even number of values, how is the median determined?",
    options: [
      "By calculating the arithmetic average of the two middle values after arranging all data in numerical order",
      "By selecting the highest value in the entire population",

      "By subtracting the lowest value from the highest value"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "For an even number of items (e.g., N = 12), the median is the mean of the two central numbers (items 6 and 7)."

    id: 20,
    lo: "Princple",
    question: "Why do economists and insurers prefer using the median rather than the mean when analyzing household incomes and wealth?",
    options: [
      "Because the median is resistant to extreme high-income outliers that heavily skew and distort the arithmetic mean",
      "Because calculating the median is legally required by state insurance commissioners",
      "Because the median always produces a larger number than the mean",
      "Because the median eliminates the need to arrange values in numerical order"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "In highly skewed distributions like income (where a few billionaires pull the mean upward), the median provides a far more accurate representation of typical middle-class earnings."
  },

    id: 21,
    lo: "Princple",
    question: "What is a key limitation of the median as a measure of central tendency?",
    options: [
      "It ignores the actual numerical magnitude of all values in the population except for the middle value(s)",
      "It cannot be found if the dataset contains an odd number of observations",
      "It is always identical to the range",
      "It requires calculating the square root of all observed items"

      "When every value in the dataset is unique (no mode exists) or when the data is bimodal/multimodal with multiple peaks",
      "When the population consists of whole numbers",
      "When all values are arranged in ascending numerical order",
      "When the mean equals the median"
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "If no value repeats, there is no mode. If two or more values tie for highest frequency, the dataset is bimodal/multimodal, making the mode ambiguous as a single central measure."

    lo: "Princple",
    question: "Consider a dataset of 5 claim amounts: $1,000, $1,000, $1,200, $1,800, and $50,000. Which measure of central tendency is most severely distorted by the $50,000 claim?",
    options: [
      "The mean (it rises to $11,000, far above 4 out of 5 claims)",
      "The median (it becomes $50,000)",
      "The mode (it shifts to $50,000)",

      "Because variance is prohibited under Statutory Accounting Principles (SAP)",
      "Because variance does not consider all values in the population"
