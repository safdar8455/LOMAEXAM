    question: "Jason Kilpatrick named his three children—Amos, Kiley, and Rebecca—as primary beneficiaries of his life insurance policy without specifying percentages. If Jason dies and all three children are alive, how will the insurer distribute the proceeds?",
    options: ["Amos receives 100% as the eldest", "The proceeds are divided evenly among all three", "The insurer holds the funds until the children reach age 25", "The proceeds are paid to Jason's estate"],

    question: "Sophie Katsaros named her children, Mia and Zoe, as equal primary beneficiaries and her husband, Basil, as the contingent beneficiary. Zoe died in an accident two years before Sophie. Upon Sophie's death, who is entitled to the proceeds?",
    options: ["Mia and Basil divide the proceeds equally", "Mia receives 100% of the proceeds", "The proceeds go to Sophie's estate", "Mia receives 50% and Zoe's estate receives 50%"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A beneficiary must survive the insured to receive proceeds. Since Zoe predeceased Sophie, the primary beneficiary interest goes to the surviving primary beneficiary(ies). The contingent beneficiary (Basil) only receives funds if ALL primary beneficiaries are deceased."

    lo: "9A",
    question: "Juliet Chau's policy names her husband, Stephen, as primary beneficiary and her children, Sam and May, as equal contingent beneficiaries. Stephen died in 2020. Juliet died in 2023 without updating the policy. How are the proceeds distributed?",

    options: ["Designate a new beneficiary without anyone's consent", "Pay no more premiums", "Only name her estate as beneficiary", "Do nothing; the designation is frozen for Yvette's estate"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "Most policies state that the rights of any beneficiary, including irrevocable ones, terminate if they die before the insured. This allows the owner to name a new beneficiary."

    answer: 2,
    explanation: "More frequent payments (monthly vs. annual) increase insurer administrative costs and reduce interest earnings on collected premiums, so insurers charge a higher total amount for frequent modes."

    options: ["The insurer keeps the extra $20 as a fee", "The owner must select another option for the remaining $20 or the automatic option applies", "The premium for next year is automatically doubled", "The beneficiary receives the $20"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "If the dividend exceeds the premium, the owner can choose how to receive the remainder, otherwise the automatic dividend option for that policy takes over for the excess."
  },
  {

    lo: "9C",
    question: "If an insured has an outstanding policy loan and applies their dividends toward it, the insurer typically applies the money first to:",

    options: ["Can surrender the policy for cash without bank consent", "Loses the right to change the beneficiary", "Retains rights that don't affect policy value (like naming beneficiaries)", "Must pay interest to the beneficiary"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "In a collateral assignment, the owner retains non-monetary rights like naming beneficiaries, but cannot diminish the policy value (loans/surrender) without the assignee's consent."

    options: ["Nils' estate", "The contingent beneficiary named by Lars", "The state", "The hospital"],
    answer: 1,
